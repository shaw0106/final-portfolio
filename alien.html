    <p class="soon"><strong>Alien is an iconic movie that resonated tension and fear </strong> with every passing moment.
      I chose to use Alien as my movie poster redesign because I wanted to recreate the tension of the film and update the iconic original poster.
      <br>
      Using my technical skills I created this poster in Photoshop from images using filters and effects, starting from several sketched ideas.
